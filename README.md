# DUNGEONS & DRAGONS: SHADOW OVER MYSTARA

Project II for Videogame Development subject. The main goal here is to create a simple plattaformer with two levels done in Tiled, having a main character moving around while being able to save and load game’s state. On top of this enemies pathfinding is implemented along other stuff such as stable frame rate (30fps), normalized movement, structured entity system described in an UML file and code with Brofiler integration. We also have added an intro menu and HUD implemented through a strucured ui system described in a UML file.

This project has been done by seven spanish students of CITM - UPC (Terrasa, Spain).
