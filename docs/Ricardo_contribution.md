I am the manager of this team. My role was to make the team have a good organization and make everyone work on what they want to work and are most efficient at. Up until vertical slice I took on mostly programming tasks. Then as more art work arised, I changed into that department. My main tasks have been:

* Working on the GDD.

* Setting up Appveyor for quick releases.

* Base UI for multi-line labels (later revamped by Sito and Alex).

* Get animations for characters and enemies.

* All items arrangement.

* Get art from the real game and adapt it to our game via photoshop (mostly map backgrounds).

* All sounds and music implementation, choosing, creating or looking for adequate sounds and edit.

* About scene.

* Testing and balancing of the game.

* Creating basic design for altered stats icons.

* Elf skills icons.

* Usability proposals.
