My main role in this project has been head of QA. My main goal during the development has been having the game as complete as possible and make it playable, with as less minor bugs as it has been possible and balanced. Besides QA I’ve also been working in code, design and I’ve worked in some minor art aspects of the game.
My main contributions to the project have been:
* QA Plan.
* Taking some sprites.
* Main Menu.
* Settings menu.
* UI in combat.
* Combat Menu.
* Skill Tree.
* Implement some items.
* Add the video manager.
* Implement Joystick inputs.
* Test, bug solving and testing.
