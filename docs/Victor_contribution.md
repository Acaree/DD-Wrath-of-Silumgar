# VÃ­ctor Tirado

My main role in this project has been head design, my main goal has been to get people to have a good time and want to play once finished. Apart from design.
I have worked on other sections such as art and code. I've done:

* Part of the GDD
* Take sprites from heroes.
* Take sprites from enemies.
* Narrative of the game.
* Create half of icons for the world map.
* Create maps.
* Spawn enemies in maps.
* Win/Lose condition.
* Add items in xml.
* All decisions in game.
* Improving art:
	* New background in Skill Tree.
	* Adding shadows at enemies.
	* New drawing of skills (warrior)
* Balancing & testing.
