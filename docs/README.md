# DUNGEONS & DRAGONS: SHADOW OVER MYSTARA TEST WEB

Project II for Videogame Development subject. The main goal here is to redesign the arcade game Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara. Enemies pathfinding is implemented along other stuff such as stable frame rate (60fps), normalized movement, structured entity system described in an UML file and code with Brofiler integration. We also have added an intro menu and HUD implemented through a structured ui system described in a UML file.

This project has been done by seven spanish students of CITM - UPC (Terrasa, Spain).
