In this project I've been in charge of the art. My role has been to work on the visual part of the game and to supervise it so it all ends up looking as good as possible. I've done:

* Art bible document
* Technical profile document
* Together with all the group members, I've worked on the game design
* I've taken all the animations of all the entities, with the help of Ricardo and Victor
* I've taken all the backgrounds for the combat scenes and modified them so it all looked good with our game, with the help of Ricardo
* Icons for the abilities in the skill trees of the heroes, with the help of Ricardo and Victor
* Icons for the world map locations, with the help of Ricardo
* Drawings for the starting story
* The XML file of the entities' abilities
* Icons for the status conditions (burn, poison, stun, bleeding)
* Icons of the altered statistics with the help of Ricardo and Victor
* I've added shadows to all the entities in the game, with the help of Ricardo and Victor
* I've taken audios for some of the enemies
* I've been in charge to fix or redo the art tasks that didn't work properly
* I've helped Guillermo and added the altered stats and status conditions missing to the game
* I've loaded all the entities statistics
* Balancing & testing
* Gameplay video
